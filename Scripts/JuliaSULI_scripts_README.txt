"ec1_master_data.R" is a script written to create a few different .rds files for use in subsequent analyses. It reads in downloaded EC1 data files about water analyses and pulls in an .rds file from the #ec1-tai-geochemistry repository. These files are combined to export a .rds file with all the water data merged with all available metadata (water_data_mergedwithallmeta.rds) and does the same with the soil data - soil .rds file combined with other metadata (soils_data_mergedwithallmeta.rds). These two data frames are put together and exported as EC1_water_soil_data.rds. 
This script also manipulates the collection level metadata to pull a list of lat/long coordinates for each transect location of each kit. This data frame is written out as a .csv file for use in other scripts to make maps and to extract spatial data.

"data_exploration.Rmd" was the first script I worked with to play with the EC1 data of interest. The first section includes the code needed to make pretty decent maps of the sample locations and spatial patterns in certain variables like SUVA, salinity, and NPOC. Most of the middle chunk of the script is exploratory analysis of the relationship between CDOM spectral metrics as I was reading papers about their meanings. I did some simple plots, a PCA, tried an NMDS, and also played with a dendrogram to understand how sample locations were grouping/separating out based on surface water OM composition. There's also a small section playing with total carbon data in the soils - patterns across regions and transect locations as well as connections between soil carbon percentages and surface water NPOC concentrations (spoiler alert --> there's NOT a relationship at all!!!). The end of this script includes exploratory work on the WSOM extracts I did for my SULI and for other potential kits to do future extractions with. This work including investigating the range in surface water pH and salinity as well as soil conductivity and pH that extracted sites/target sites represented.

"wsom_extracts_npoc_tdn.R" is the processing script for the TOC-L data. Code is based on Peter's EXCHANGE and Allison's TEMPEST processing scripts. Something to note is that the TDN data is not completely blank corrected - process blanks were only run 2x diluted for TDN but that didn't really make sense so TDN values were just blank corrected with the average of unadjusted process blank TDN values. Script exports processed NPOC/TDN data in a file named EC1_WSOM_Extracts_NPOC_TDN_L0B.csv.

"wsoc_conc_calcs.R" reads in the processed NPOC/TDN data and a spreadsheet from the extract lab work to calculate wsoc and wson concentrations in the extracts, normalized based on the methods from Wardinski et. al. 2022 for the amount of volume of MQ water and amount of soil used for extraction. There's also code that calculates "field soil" concentrations, based on converting freeze-dried soil masses back to approx. field moist masses based on GWC. Several files are written out from this script: 
wsom_extracts_wsoc_wson_conc.csv --> concentrations by sample extracted
wsom_extracts_npoc_tdn_perc_error_calcs.csv --> small data frame with percent error calcs for the replicate extracts
wsom_conc_rep_avg.csv --> final spreadsheet with the kits w/ replicates averaged (ex: K018 run twice, average those conc values moving forward)

"wsom_extracts_analysis.Rmd" is where I did the bulk of the statistical analyses (ANOVAs and non-parametric ANOVAs) on the WSOC concentrations of the extracts. I also calculated some correlations and did some linear models between these concentrations and other soil characteristics like total carbon, LOW, GWC, and LOI - also looked at WSOC concentrations vs. surface water DOC and came to the conclusion that surface water DOC is not significantly driven by simply the carbon concentration in nearby soils. All the figures for my SULI presentation and write-up related to organic matter CONCENTRATION are made in this script and written out to the "Saved Figures" folder.

"cdom_extracts_analysis.Rmd" has all the work associated with analyzing the organic matter composition in the soil extracts vs adjacent surface waters. Figures written out from this script include boxplots of different spectral indices and a PCA plot. At the end of the script, there is a prelim exploratory analysis for the Chesapeake Bay extracts, looking at the relationship between pH and salinity/conductivity and multiple spectral indices (but mainly SUVA254).

"wsom_composition_ghg_do_exploration.Rmd" includes an exploratory analysis of the relationship between WSOM extract spectral indices and oxygen drawdown/GHG concentration based on Peter's soil incubation experiments. It includes scatterplots, boxplots, a PCA, and some barplots looking at patterns across transect locations for combinations of measurements from these two experiments.
