README for JuliaSULI Repository
Created: 2023-03-09

This outlines the folders and their contents for the Julia SULI repository!

- "Downloaded Data" --> this folder has downloaded copies of EC1 data from the EXCHANGE External GDrive that I used mainly for data exploration and then for comparisons of WSOM extracts composition to surface water data. These .csv files are not the most recent data AT ALL.

- "Saved Figures" --> contains the exported figures that went into my SULI slides and SULI project report

- "Scripts" --> all scripts are here! this folder has its own readme that describes each of the scripts.

- "Spatial" --> includes the scripts, shapefiles, and any other files related to the work I did with external spatial data for EXCHANGE.

- "SULI Deliverables" --> copies of my two abstracts, slides, and research report that were turned into the DOE. 

- "WSOM Extracts Data" --> contains all the data, both raw and processed, that was generated during my soil extractions

The root of the repository also has a few random excel files that didn't really belong in any of the folders, like .rds master EC1 data files (for water, soils, and a combined one) that I used in several scripts, information on the TOC-L instrument's LOD for NPOC/TDN corrections, and a spreadsheet of the digitized SPE recoveries for the extracts.
