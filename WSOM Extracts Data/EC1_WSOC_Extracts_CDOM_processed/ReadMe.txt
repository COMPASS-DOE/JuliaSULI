This folder contains absorbance and fluorescence (as excitation emission matrices) data for Exchange Campaign 1 for Water Soluble Extrable Carbon from sediments.
Data were analyzed in November 2022 by Julia McElhinny.  
Samples were analyzed on the Aqualog. 
All EEM samples were Blank Corrected, Inner Filter Corrected, normalized to Raman Scatter Units (RSU) and dilution corrected in Matlab 2020b. 

Experiment Specific Notes:

Experimental blanks were collected for this experiment. 1 in which a MQ was added straight to a falcon tube, and another where MQ water was passed
through a filter into a falcon tube similar to how WSOC was treated. A noticeable low Ex/EM signal was observed near the 'protein-like' region, although
not directly in the region. Ex/Em max was somwhere around 250/300. Note however that most of this signal is removed at the Ex 260 nm cutoff. However the signal
was large enough that it provided some minor interferences in the regions that we target. This signal was noticeable in the MQ falcon tube blank, but magnified
2 fold in the blank that passed through a filter. To correct for this, rather than simply subtracting a standard MQwater blank from the 
signal (current protocol), we subtracted the filter blank from all samples (except for the Tea standards which did not go through the same sample treatment). 
Note that the WSOC was analyzed in 3 groups that corresponded to sediments collected in from upland, transition, and wetland zones respectively and three
filter blanks collected along with each group of extractions (1 =  uplands, 2 = transition, and 3 = wetlands). Filter blanks 1 and 2 were initially collected
at 2 second integration times and filter blank 3 was collected at 4s integration times that corresponded with the general integration times for the bulk of 
the samples. At the end, a 1s integration time was further collected for filter blank 1 and an addition 4s integration time was collected on filter blank 2. 
Filter blank 1 with a 1 second integration time was subtracted from all upland samples with a 1s integration time. 
Filter blank 1 with a 2s integration time had a noticeable spike at Ex380/Em464 causing some issues when subtracting this out from samples, 
thus the filter blank 2 with a 2s integration time was subtracted from the upland samples with 2s integration time. This was possible because raman
normalization factors were comparable for both days in which these blanks were corrected. 
The filter blank 2 with a 4s integration time was subtracted from upland samples with a 4s integration time as we did not have a 4s integration time ran
for filter blank 1. 
The filter blank 2 with a 2s and 4s integration time were subtracted for the respective transition zone samples
The filter blank 3 with a 4s integration time was subtracted from the wetland zone samples. 

Note that EEM contour figures are provided for both the falcon tube and filter blanks to provide a visual of the signal that was present. However, spectral
indices and peak picks for these are not provided as most of the singals we collect for are not present and are just negative numbers. 


This folder contains the following files and folders. 

1) 1. Absorbance Files - Contains all absorbance files.
2) 2. Fluorescence Blank Files - Contains the blank files that were subtracted from each EEM file.
3) 3. Fluorescence Files - This contains EEM files taken from the instrument. These EEMs are blank subtracted, inner filter corrected, and
raman normalized.  
4) 4. Corrected Fluorescence Files_ESS_DIVE - This folder contains all EEMs. These are EES-DIVE ready. Any samples that were diluted for 
analysis have been corrected for dilution.  '*_DilCorr_IFE_RamNorm_*' in file names indicates dilution corrected, inner filter corrected,
and Raman Normalized (RSU) spectra. Note that if no dilution was performed the spectra is equivalent to what is in folder 3.
5) 5. Corrected Absorbance Files_ESS_DIVE - This folder contains all dilution corrected absorbance files. These are EES-DIVE ready.
Any samples that were diluted for analysis have been corrected for dilution. '*_DilCorr_*' in file names indicates dilution corrected spectra. 
Note that if no dilution was performed the spectra is equivalent to what is in folder 1. 
6) 6. Figures - contains all EEM contour plots. For the purpose of these plots, all EEMs data was normalized to 1 mg/L DOC. Intesity units
are in RSU/DOC(mg/L). 1st order Raman scatter was smoothed. However, Rayleigh scatter cannot be smoothed. Smoothing of 2nd order Raman and Rayleigh
scatter, but these provide weird features in the EEMs, so these were left unsmoothed.
7) 7. Spectral Indices- contains individual CSV files that represent Spectral Indices, Abs/EEMs Peak Picks, and 
Abs/EEM peak picks that were DOC normalized. In the '*PeakPicks_RSU.csv' file, fluorescence peaks (A,C,M,T,B) are in units of RSU. Absorbance 
peaks (A250, A254, etc) are technically unitless, although often reported as Absorbance Units (AU). In the '*PeakPicks_DOCnormalized.csv' file,
all data was divided by DOC concentration. Thus fluorescence peaks are in RSU/DOC(mg/L) and absorbance peaks are in AU/DOC(mg/L). A SpectralIndices_ReadMe.csv was
 also provided with information on peak picks and references. 
8) 8. Falcon Tube Experimental Blanks - Contains Falcon tube MQ experimental blanks and associated standard MQ blanks (MQ blanks normally collected with each run). 
9) 9. Sample MQ Water Blanks - Contains standard MQ Blanks that are collected with each run that are associated with each sample. These are typically what is 
blank subtracted from EEMs, but in this case we used the Filter Experimental Blanks. These included here just for documentation purposes.  
10) Sample Log - contains all sample EEM information and pairings with respective absorbance and blanks.
Contains Sample Integration Time, Raman Normalization Factor, Dilution Factors, and DOC concentrations. Note that the code
raman corrects all EEMs based on the Raman Normalization Factor for a 1 second integration and the integration 
time for which the sample was ran.
